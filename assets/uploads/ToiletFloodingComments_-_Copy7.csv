"apparently, it damaged both the ceiling and the wall-to-wall carpeting of the unit below mine.  . . I own my condo, but the woman below me rents so today I got a call from her landlord (which I expected)... he said he will contact his insurance co.. . I believe that whatever his ins. doesn't cover, I am responsible for, but what can I expect to pay?  Is there like an insurance deductable like with car insurance?  I probably should have asked more questions while I was on the phone with him, but I was caught off guard at the time of the phone call.... . any input?  anyone been in a similar situation? Thanks.

Plumbing Question ... House not getting water and toilet leaking from base... wax ring already replaced?
Can someone explain to me what my problem is or about how much it will be to fix a plumbing problem?
"Can anyone help me with this pretty awkward problem? . . I left a tap running over the bathroom wash basin this morning and the water promptly flooded the sink and then ran out over the bathroom floor. The water then ran through the wooden floor and has since come through the kitchen sink through the side of the main light fitting. I reckon about a bucket full of water ran onto the floor. Can anyone please tell me how I ought to deal with this, and do I need to get the light socket removed to guarantee our total safety?."

When Archimedes was sorting his principles out in the bath did he flood the bathroom and bring the ceiling?
"Today, my five-year-old son came out of the bathroom laughing, and he had wet socks. I asked him why he had wet socks and he replied ""I accidently spilled some on them when I washed."". Then, about twenty minutes later, I went into the kitchen, which was completely flooded, with the ceiling dripping. I ran to the hall, and the stairs were like a waterfall, I managed to get up them without slipping, and into the bathroom, where the basin and bath were overflowing, and gushing water everywhere. Aswell as this, the window was smashed, the mirror was cracked, there was toilet paper all over the ceiling, and the toilet seat had been pulled off. Also, our neighbours' bedroom wall collapsed, as the room is right next to our bathroom. The ceiling is peeling off in our kitchen, and the oven, the microwave, the fridge and the toaster are all broken. What can I do about this?."
"The bathroom tap was left on, bathroom flooded - came through floor into dining room... electric safe?"
"The manager has left me with a leaking ceiling which is dripping through the light, is this dangerous?"
"I'm in uni halls, and i've been here for three weeks now. We've had several problems with our shower to start off with. Firstly we had no hot water and now the shower keeps tripping so we have no power, which is an issue because we have an electric shower. So there is obviously a problem there, which is earthing the switch in the fuse box. We've reported this many time, and all we keep getting is people turning the switch back on, so it works again. Now, i get home to find my bathroom is flooded ( its in a seperate room to the shower). The water is dripping through the ceiling, through the light fixation and the fan fixture. I'm assuming this is because it is the only way it can escape, however, as far as i'm aware.. water and electricity don't mix! I've reported this, and the manager came up, said she wont do anything until Monday, and hasn't turned the water off in my flat or the electricity. All she has said, is don't use the light switch. Surely this is very unsafe? Not only do we face the risk of an electric shock, but were left with water coming through our ceiling and flooding our bathroom.  I know a little bit about electricity, such as if the water is allowed to keep coming through the light, it can blow the whole lighting system in my flat? Anyway, I feel as if i've been left in a pretty uncomfortable situation for the whole weekend, without a shower and a leaking ceiling. I also feel like  I shouldn't be left with water coming through the light. I don't really know what to do, and I don't even know if I can fight my case about being left in this situation. Any comment will be much appreciated! Thanks,."

Light bulb popped/exploded in ceiling light after a small flood what should I do?
"ceiling lights in bathroom/recessed lights above sink/mirror, YES, OR NO...?"
"Remodel, my wife wants to put two ceiling recessed lights (can lights) over bathroom sink/mirror.  There will also be a center light for room.  Rather then using the usual light bar/light strip above mirror which floods the face with light, I am worried the can lights will put shadows on the face since the light will be from the ceiling over head.  I am sure this will be reduced by reflection of the light as it bounces around and the center room light.... but concerned before I do this as to change wouldn't be easy once done... . . So what say you, you builders of the night... has anyone ever seen this done, done this before?. . Thanks in advance...."

"Burst water pipe, ceiling has fallen???? WHAT DO I DO.?"
"Okay so there was a burst waterpipe, and the bathroom flooded. It leaked into the downstairs bathroom, and the livingroom, before we could turn off the water supply. Now, a bit of the ceiling of the living has freaking collapsed. We rang the emergency plumber before it collapsed, and not sure when they'll be here. But i don't think they specialise in ceiling collapses!?!? Who should we ring??!?!."
Last year we re-painted the kitchen ceiling and now there are various brown circles appearing that do not wash off.

What are these brown spots?.

"Last September upstairs flooded my ceiling. Afer waiting for them to repair their bathroom, and for my room to dry out, we repainted. Now brown patches have appeared, patchily, in the area of the original leak (albeit not where the water most came through). There is no dripping water. Did I not leave enough time for the ceiling to dry out over winter (my flat wasn't heated as the heating wasn't working!), or is this a new leak? the property is a victoria terraced house convered into flats.."

But when they did (my mother was in the garage while my older sister turned the hose on) the master bedroom, where the jacuzzi was, flooded and the bathroom was flooded also. My mother was yelling downstairs and apparently water was coming from the ceiling tiles and some has collapsed. The hose had barely been on for two minutes yet it caused this much damage! :( We just took out the other ceiling tiles from the garage that were wet and have yet to take out the lights which have water in them (we turned the lights off) but can anyone tell me why this happened? While I was taking out some tiles from the garage I saw the the insulation above it was somewhat wet too :/. Can someone help us fix this asap please!!."

An upper level pipe burst and flooded a house that I am interested in buying.?
"A house was abandoned, and a pipe burst in an upstairs bathroom.  The water went through the ceiling, to the kitchen, through the kitchen floor, down to the basement.  Nobody noticed for over a week that the house flooded.  My husband and I are interested in buying the house for a very reasonable price, and we do know that we would have to put in new sheet rock, flooring, and ceilings.  There is also mold in the basement. I have heard bleach will kill the mold, and the house would be just like new once the wood dries out.  We know that this would be a lot of work, but is it a good idea? I'm afraid that it could end up being one problem after another, or we may discover that something extreme, like the whole house having to be torn down, could happen.."

Their bathroom was flooded. Somehow, the water leaked in my apartment. Water was pouring through my ceiling. Thank god no water leaked in the bedrooms. The maintenance men managed to stop the water and they dried my carpet. I left my place for awhile until the carpet was okay. When I got back home, my whole place smelled like mildew. I can't stand it. Is there anything I can use to get rid of the smell temporarily? The men are supposed to come back tomorrow to clean the carpet and get the smell out. I just don't want to have to smell this when I sleep. Is there anything I can use? Any ideas?."

How to fix water damage in the ceiling and is there possible damage to the insulation?
My housemates managed to flood the cistern in the toilet for several minutes which then seeped down the wall and into the kitchen.   Our kitchen is longer than our upstairs bathroom so there is now stains on our ceiling.   Only a few drops have come through but I can feel a bit of a sag and am afraid water has pooled.   The landlord has said he is on the way so I dont want to do anything.   I know we should put a hole in the ceiling to let the water through etc. and that it's not the end of the world but would there be damage to the insulation and if so what would the cost be?.
My landlord won't fix anything. Can I break the lease?
"The upstairs apartment bathroom flooded a month and a half ago and the ceiling is all warped and entire tiles had to be taken down.  Since she was there to fix the leak, she hasn't come back to fix the ceiling, which is bowed and causing a cold draft to come in.  The ceiling in the hallway in front of the bathroom is warped and the light fixture is loose now (the water was leaking through that part too).  In addition, this past fall she was supposed to install supplemental heating in the front bedroom and never did.  This winter you could literally see your breath in the room so we had to use ceramic heaters, which jacked the electric bill up.  Long story short, we're stuck in a lease until October and I want out now.  I'm sick of this apartment and the fact that she takes forever to take care of anything.  I took pictures of the damage in the bathroom.  Do I have any chance of legally breaking out of this lease?."
"Almost a week ago, we got new neighbors upstairs. They moved in quietly, and then the next day, I was woken up to what sounded like rain in my bathroom. Our bathroom was being flooded from a leak (not a tiny one, either) in the ceiling. After throwing down as many towels, buckets, and anything else to stop it from leaking down to the bottom floor, I went upstairs to see if everything was alright. One of the tenants explained that they had been replacing the shower head, and a pipe broke. One of the repair guys for our apartment was already cleaning up the damage. The water had been shut off, and I could hear him working.. . I explained that our bathroom was flooded, and she told me she'd send the repair man down to us when he was done. Two hours later, she came down to see the damage herself... and asked if he'd been there. I told her he hadn't... and she was very distressed at the damage.. . A week later, the bathroom smells like mold, despite my best efforts, there are flies swarming around, even hiding in areas I didn't know existed, and the ceiling where the water came through is beginning to bend and warp... nevermind that it looks like someone wet themselves on our ceiling, and it's dried.. . I've called our landlord once a day for the last week, and I've received nothing but a message machine or a non-committal ""We'll send someone out there."" My boyfriend and I do not have the funds to fix this (we can't even use the washing machine because we don't have quarters for it...) and I'm beginning to feel my patience wearing thin.. . Is there something or someone I can speak to who will actually *do* something about the damage? My boyfriend thinks the ceiling tiles may be made with asbestos, and since this is an old building, I'm not exactly going to tell him that's silly thinking. We don't know what to do!."
Should i be concerned with mold forming in my apartment after a flood in the apartment above me ??. ?
So I came home from work to my kitchen covered in water. My ceiling was leaking water through my light fixtures and coming down like rain. I contacted my apartments office and the maint. crew responded. Aparently the neighbors above me moved out and when the cleaning crew was there they disconnected the fridge and the water pipe was pumping out water and flooded the entire upstairs and the water was comming through the ceiling. The property manager said that it has happened before and told me I should just wait until tomorrow before turning on my lights again while the ceiling drains out. he said its nothign to worry about. But i was looking at my ceiling and I notice slight bubble in the drywall. I also have water stains covered by paint in my bathroom. What action should i expect from them? Im concerned of possible mold growth because when i touch the ceiling i notice weakness/ soft spots.  is this a hazzard? Would it be ok to ask for them to test for mold or replace my ceiling if i am concerned? Im located in Scottsdale AZ anything on apartment help for renters.  Nothing was damged only the ceiling. I took sevral pictures documenting the occurance..
"Need less to say that I am moving out of these apartments, but I have had nothing but problems since day one that we moved in. During the first inspection of the apartment I advised the landlord that there was a major problem with spiders in the entire apartment and that the counter tops had burn marks on them, nothing was done. Next about two months in to the lease the person above us apartment caught fire and flooded our living room, bathroom, and kitchen area. Still with more to come like nothing else could go wrong, every time that it rains all the windows leak and just a few weeks ago we had a really nice cold front to come through and the windows froze over and showed that they had been growing  mold on them. Last but not least when they notified us that they would be making routine checks on the sprinkler system they ended up doing something to the one in the master bath causing the bathroom to flood (once again) where they had to come back and cut a whole in the ceiling to fix the issue but never repaired the whole. I have contacted the front office about the problems in my apartment and they have done nothing but make the situation worse so I feel that something else needs to be done. I am looking for some legal advise her do I have a case or just wasting my time and I need to just wait till I move to another property?  ( Just in case any of you are wondering the apartment name is Cambridge at Hickory Hollow in Antioch, TN)."
is there anyway to stop the madness? without catching a case.?
"Help, I live in a ""slum"" and the management won't fix anything!!!?"

Im pregnant and when my husband is at work im stuck to cleaning it up which is stressing me out and im to the point id like to knock some sense into her but would like to know my rights before hand. please help if you know anything about these problems.

"i live in an apartment complex with really bad plumbing.  earlier i got home and my neighbor's daughter was telling me the sewage had backed up and her mom was telling management.  sure enough the little pipe out front was flooded with poo and water.  ok so i get into my apt and our front bathroom toilet is backed up.  no one ever uses that toilet.  i went out front to ask the guys if i needed to use the plunger or what.  they were snaking the pipe out front.  they said dont touch the toilet.  well, they are long gone and the office is now closed and im still left with a backed up commode.  tried to flush and the water rises to almost the very top of the bowl then goes down.  plunging did nothing.  they wont send anyone back out now.  please help i have two small kids and it's extremely unsanitary to have a commode full of nasty junk.. murphy's law always gets those with deployed spouses.  thanks!."
"I have a clogged toilet drain.  After plunging didn't clear problem, I removed the toilet and tried a snake.  The snake wouldn't go beyond a certain point no matter how many times I tried, but the problem seemed fixed for the first few flushes until it quickly clogged again.  I assume the clog had just moved further down the line beyond the reach of the snake, so I tried one of those high pressure water bladders.  This too was unsuccessful, but I only ran the water for a short time.  When I turned the water off, the drain back-flowed onto the floor & there is still water in the pipe.  Clearly, the clog is still there.  Before I try it again, I want to know how long I can/should run the water through the bladder?  Can it damage the drain pipe if it runs too long?  And how will I know if & when the clog clears? Is there a sound to listen for?  I don't want to keep flooding the bathroom.  Thanks.."

"..................my husband used the bathroom yesterday, clogged the toilet, it was where the water was at the top and then he left for a few days.. . . I didn't know what to do so I left it alone and figured the problem might fix itself.. . This morning I woke up and really had to use the bathroom, and the water was down to the bottom so I was like ""Oh ok. We might be ok."" . . So I flushed it.. Then I saw the water rising all the way to the top again. . And then I screamed while my bathroom was flooding with poopy water. . . Disgusting. I'm going to cry, now I need new towels because they're covered in POO. . . So. . I still really have to go to the bathroom, the water looks like its at normal level now, if I flush it again it won't flood the bathroom again will it?.

Water flooded in my bathroom, plumbers turned water back off, and said somebody had flushed something down the toilet and clogged the drains. they rotted it out, turned the water back on, everything was fine. next morning, my bathroom flooded again, plumbers came and said that drain was still clogged because they didn't rot everything out. My insurance is not paying for it due to an exclusion in the policy. my question is: DO I HAVE TO PROVE NEGLIGENCE IN ORDER TO GO AFTER MY CONDO ASSOCIATION, or do they have to pay for it regardless?."

"Slumlord in Ca, What are my rights and what actions should I take?"
"I noticed my toilet was backed up, plunged it, tried flushing it, managed to flood my bathroom floor and went back to plunging, but there was no change. For kicks and giggles I checked my bathtub to see that it was flooding with sewage water as well. This was all in the guest bathroom. I then checked the master bathroom and saw the shower there was in similar condition. I haven't had the courage to check the toilet in there expecting it to be the same. The water will go down in the toilet if I plunge it, but only a little bit, almost like I'm forcing it through. I've tried snaking all three drains, and pouring boiling water down them, but to no avail. Nothing is wrong with the sinks yet, but I assume it's only a matter of time. My theory is that the master drain to the sewer is plugged. Is that right? If so, is that something I can fix myself or do I need to call in a professional?."
"Ok, I was laying on my bed and I had a hole in my wall. I looked at the hole and saw a weird bird trying to fly in. My cat was sitting on my bed and I pointed at the bird and told my cat to get the bird. Just as I pointed the bird came flying at me and started biting my finger with it's sharp teeth, it really hurt. I took my hand to my cat and told her to bite the bird which she did. The bird was screeching loud but wasn't letting go. I decided to run to the bathroom and stick the bird under water hoping if I tried drowning it it would open it's mouth to try and get air. As I did this, the toilet flushed and clogged from the bird going down the drain. My whole bathroom flooded and I was cleaning up the mess until I woke up.. . What did my dream mean?."
I have clogged sewers in my basement. What should i do?
"So I had moved in to my house almost a year ago and after a few months, while doing laundry the water started backing up through the pipe. A plumber came out and pulled a metal rod and said that had been clogging it. It worked for a while but now i was doing laundry and the sink, and toilet started making a gargling sound. Then the toilet started over flowing and the water from the washer started to back up and spit water everywhere. I have been plunging at the toilet and my bathroom is flooded. I have no idea what to do."
"Does home owner's insurance cover a visiting, retarded child clogging the toilet and neglecting to tell any one until it floods the bathroom, adjacent bedroom, hall, and goes through the wall and floods the foyer and living room?  I just don't know how I am going to clean all this up!  It is unsanitary and in my walls!  I am totally freaked!."
Will a laxative help me with this? Is this a problem?

DID CRYSTAL HEAT DRAIN OPENER CLOG MY DRAIN EVEN MORE?
"We noticed our plumbing was backed up in the toilet and the bath tub.  My husband went out and purchased Zeps Crystal Heat Drain Opener.  He poured in a heaping teaspoon (probably a tablespoon..a lil more than instructed) followed by cold water.  The plumbing has not gone down.  It bubbled up and everything came back up the toilets and bathtubs.  Me not thinking about it, also did a load of laundry which contributed to additional backup and oveerflow in the bathroom and flooded the bathroom floor.  . . We tried using a home snake to unclog the drain.  Will probably go to homedepot and get one of those heavy duty snakes for the drain... Are there any suggestions?  I read that the crystals could have potentially heated up into a crystal brick and permanently clog the drain.  Is that right?  Will snaking the drain work?  We also have drain cleaner, but I am concerned with mixing two chemicals.  I'm not chemist, but it might be dangerous.. . Any help you can provide for us DIYers would be appreciated.. . Thank you!. ....another question.  How does the plumbing go from a backed up toilet and slow draining shower one day (and doing the laundry without any apparent issues)...the next day we pour Heat Crystal Drain Openers and that night everything backs up into the toilet and bathtub when we do laundry again?  Did the Crystals perhaps move the clog further down the main line?  Just trying to understand... Will ask one of the experts when we rent the snake and then we'll probably bite the bullet and call the plumber.  Thanks!. also...looks like the clean out in the frontyard is overflowing/full as well.. PROBLEM SOLVED.. . Massive root growth in the main line from the wonderful tree's the City Planted.."

"When my washer spins, the water comes up in the sinks. Why?"
what rights do i have as a tenant in texas?
"My family and I rent a townhome and our upstairs bathroom flooded without warning, called the landlord (manager) and maintenance stopped the toilet from flooding further, and got the water mostly out of the carpet, but the bathroom is right above our garage. My car was in the garage, the stucco from the ceiling fell on my car and is now hardening on my car. There is now a huge hole in our garage ceiling, pipes showing and all. Still water sitting in our garage. Can I request someone to evaluate the building to see if it's unsafe to live in? I'm afraid of mold forming and my family getting sick from this. Also, it seems unsafe to go into the bathroom now that there is a hole under the bathroom floor.."
"Hi so the second story bathroom of my house flooded, and a ton of water leaked thought to the garage below. i started cleaning up the upstairs bathroom, and the water looke d abit funny to me then.. Then when i got downstaris, the water was a dark yellowish color. What caused the yellow color?."
"I'm removing radiators from all three upstairs bedrooms for re-plastering / decorating (no problem).. In one room, the 'pin' of the lock-shield valve is broken and can no longer be turned (even with pliers / mole-grips - fortunately, it is stuck in the off position).  I intend to replace this valve.. What is the best way for me to do this, particularly in terms of not having a mini-flood from the system?. A slight snag is that I have an upstairs bathroom with a towell-radiator that I wasn't wanting to remove, and am concerned that the water in this might gush out when I remove the valve in the bedroom - perhaps I will end up draining this towell-rail also - but will I need to if I turn its valves to the off position?  I assume that the water in the downstairs radiators won't gush upstairs to escape when this valve is removed, due to them being at a lower level, so won't need draining.  . Any useful tips on the actual replacement of the valve itself would be welcome. . Thanks."
There's black mold in my apt and my heater went out last night?
"My family lives in a VERY old house. My mother has autoimmune issues and is unable to work so we live with my grandmother. My grandmother was diagnosed with lung cancer about a year ago. (lifelong smoker). About the same time, we noticed that the bit of mold that we had in our bathroom was BLACK mold.. . Since then, through various events, we now have mold behind the walls in our downstairs bathroom, under the carpet and in the toilet in our upstairs bathroom (we don't use this bathroom because the toilet and sink are very old and do not work), and all over our basement. All of these things are due to problems with our pipes. The shower leaks into the basement, which has spurred mold down there. Water leaks from rain all over the house, which probably means we have mold throughout the house. The toilet upstairs floods when we try to flush it to clean it, and today it started raining in our downstairs bathroom when this happened. We then lifted up the carpet to try to help dry the area to find severe mold.. . My mother and grandmother have severe illnesses and should not be around this mold, and I don't want to be around the mold either. I'm just a high school student and I don't know how to handle the mold, and neither of them should try to remove it themselves, but we don't have the money to hire a mold remediator.. . WHAT SHOULD I DO?. . I don't like the fact that I don't feel like my home is healthy. . I just want to move into a new home, but that is not possible.. . Please, what can I do?. I'm out of ideas and helpless.."
"Right guys, last night I went into the bathroom to find it flooded - the IDIOT who lives upstairs flooded his bathroom, and all the water poured down into our bathroom.  I looked up (The lights werent on) and I seen most of the water was dripping down from the lights, so its obvious they got soaked in the flood too.  Ive not turned them on since.  Do you think I should just wait a few days so they can dry out?  Or should I get an electrician or something to take the whole circuit apart and replace anything if necessary?  Or do you think it will be OK to use now?  . . Thanks in advance for all answers, guys  :-)."
Ok so yesterday I had my main line roded by plumbers they got a decent amount of roots out.. but thats about it. Flushed the toilet like they asked me to. and it was fine for a few mins without the water seeping out from underneath after they left BAM it started leaking I called them back and they say i'm sol they already left. WELL since i got f^cked over more or less I removed the toilet because i need to replace the wax now. and there is water in the pipe any time i use say the kitchen sink. the water will rise in that hole. How do I have this problem fixxed. please help me out I'm in desperate need of help. I cant do dishes or laundry....let alone shower without flooding in the upstairs bathroom ( water from under the toilet ) and the earliest another plumber can be in is saturday.... What could be the problem? and whatever the problem is ... how can i fix the damn thing. :( thank you for any help you may give... ugh.
"I have a problem with the landlord. I rent a full house and the landlord does not do his part of obligations to fix his house. Couple of months ago, we had the basement flooded when it rained hard. All the water from outside came in our basement. Last week I called him and told him that the bathroom upstairs in the attic was leaking, and to send an electrician, but he ignored the message I left him in his voice mail. If I don't threaten him, that not to expect his by rent when its due, he comes runing for his money. This landlord is neglecting his property. I am tired of threatening him. What are my rights as a tenant?."
"Do I have legal action, my apartment is flooded with sewage?"
"Got the brown sewage seeping in every orifice of my bedroom and bathroom.  It is from upstairs neighbors.  My clothes are soaked, some dishes, Dresser.  As well as other items here and there.  I want to know if I can press legal action for ruined items. I cant live with knowing someone else's sewage was all over my clothes, even after they are washed etc.  It smells like a ses pool here.  I have documented pictures as well as time and events.  So basically someone else's negligence was the cause.  Also on top of any damages can I do anything about demanding compensation for my time and grief such as cleaning and the grief of someone else's sewage gracing my living arrangements.. No renters insurance, and I believe taht it was caused by a massive reliefe if you know what i mean."

Help! Condo owner needs advice. Negligent/filthy neighbor with extensive water damage and rat infestation!?
"I own a condo/town home.  I noticed water was puddling in my kitchen from under the baseboard of the wall that adjoins my neighbor. I called a plumber out to be sure it wasn't an issue in my unit.  Couldn't find anything here.  Noticed that the next door neighbor's patio area had a lot of collected water and also mold on the exterior siding.  Also noticed what looked like water coming down the window from inside.  Rang the doorbell and knocked w/ no answer.  Noticed her car parked out front ( she only has one).  Got worried and called condo association but couldn't reach anyone since it's Saturday.  Got really worried after extensive knocking on neighbor's door and no answer.  Called cops.  Cops come out and enter home ( back door was unlocked).  Cops find home empty but are flabergasted at the state of affairs inside.  The entire upstairs bathroom floor had collapsed into the kitchen area with water pouring down walls-- entire dining room/kitchen area flooded.  Cops also mention extensive mold on walls and rats and roaches running around!!  Garbarge everywhere inside.  A complete nightmare.  The cops said the place needs to be condemned.  Finally talk to property management company who seems to think that it's okay to wait until Monday to do anything.  We have our plumber turn off the water outside.   A few hours later a water and fire damage restoration company shows up stating they received a call from the unit owner ( landlord).  The guy says the tenant has 'been out of town' and is supposed to be meeting him there.  We inform him of what is going on inside.  Tenant shows up in a cab and promptly tells us that she was unaware of any problem and has been out of town since Wednesday.  She also mentioned that the landlord was aware of the issue before the condo association called him??  How did he know if she didn't know?? It's obvious by the extensive damage inside that this has been an ongoing problem.  Not only that but what explains the filth, garbage, and rats?!   I need some good advice on what my next steps should be.  We are going to file a complaint at city hall and I will be contacting the owner and demanding that he pay for a full inspection of my unit as well as any necessary repairs.  I am worried about the health hazard and the potential damage to my structure!  Should I seek legal help?  Any advice is greatly appreciated.."
How can I talk to the management for my townhome rentals?
"I had talked with my landlord about moving to a different unit because this one has too much space that I don't need or want and I wanted an end unit.  Well a few end units became available for rent last month and one of the persons mentioned that I could get into one in december.  So plans were on for me to move then on a cartain date, but then after talking with them a few weeks later they said ""oh no we were mixed up that one is not available for rent now""  the most detail that she gave to me is that it's not available and never was.. . . At one point later she said that no end units would be available until possibly spring.  This change of mind happened the week that there was a random leak in my unit that caused some flooding on the first floor near the bathroom.  I had nothing to do with it, and while it as my boyfriend that was there while they were doing repair, he did not find out what was wrong either.  Management said it was a pipe leak from the bathroom.  It would seem that they do not mind coming in to repair thing here, because there have been multiple issues since I have moved here, one was a major issue where they needed to get into the ceiling of my kitchen becaue there was a leak form the upstairs bathroom.  Days later after they went in to the ceiling and tore a huge hole in it there was another leak, but fortunately the hole as still not repaired so they could re-fix it, then they proceeded to patch the hole, and it's been fine since.  Well there have been lots of problems with this unit because I haven't demanded them to come fix some of these issues, they may not understand how problematic they are.. . How can I explain any of this to them.  and that if they're lying and there is an end unit open I'm just finding a new rental management but that isn't what I want to do.. I asked them to please fix the faucets that leak upstairs, they said it was fixed, and later that day I noticed they were still leaky.  The downstairs kitchen faucet was fixed once, and twice, what they failed to notice is that the handle on the faucet is broken, so when you move it it slides through the crack but doesn't operate the faucet keeps falling off.  There are more problems I tryedto fix myself so management wouldn't keep coming in here s I can have peace but ya lots of issues here."

My upstairs neighbor is uninsured and flooded my condo. What should I do?
"We just bought a home in June. It was empty for about a year and a half. Anyways. For starters, The owners said the house would come with this propane heater that was in the dining room. It is in the contract that the heater belongs to us from the sale of the home, and we have witnesses that saw them take the heater. They said they would drop it off, but never have. Also, to our discovery, they have plastered the walls and whatnot, and now after living in the home, it is revealing cracks above windows and doorways. It also said the home came with a working garbage disposal, which doesn't work, one of the sinks in the bathroom dosent work, the woodstove that we now have to use as a primary heat source because we have gone through an enormous amount of propane has a crack in it and has been welded together, which is now going to give way, the garage has outlets that has nothing behind them or dont work, the dishwasher does not work correctly, the basement floods when it was advertised as damp not flooding (by the way, what happens if we find mold because they had to replace and paint the walls in the backroom leading to the basement), the vents upstairs do not work, the upstairs bathroom is believed to be leaking, the air conditioner is not correctly hooked up, im sure im forgetting some stuff. Now, I know some of these may sound like easy fixes, but its just me and my mom, so we cant do much. Also, we had a home inspector inspect the house before we bought it...can we sue them? Or something? What can we do? We already put the house on the market, but it seems like we may be sitting on it for a while.."
"My boyfriend lives in an old victorian home. This past summer the basement flooded and as i know of they NEVER got it cleaned up. . I'm allergic to indoor and outdoor mold's and when ever we open the door that leads to the basement all i can smell is this horrible musky smell and it starts to make me dizzy instantly! . I know for a FACT that there is a HUG mold issue in the house. Even in the bathroom upstairs you can see the mold creeping threw the ceiling (paint chipping) and all around the tiles and everything. Its bad!! . I have an opportunity to move in with him, but i have a feeling that over the winter months its going to get even worse if its not fixed or cleaned up! . Does any one know how much this would cost the property owner to get it cleaned up? its the house even live-able? Should we live there? any suggestions would be great! . I live in the milwaukee WI area, so any company's that will come in and give a free estimate would be a huge help too! . Oh,also, should the owner pay for this? I'm assuming he would, but how do you go about doing that too???."

"Ok, here's my problem. My parents bought this house a few years ago.  No problems at first, but then during Hurricane Katrina, the basement started to flood from the heavy rains.  Now whenever it rains, it floods.  We have a half bath down there and the water would drain out in the shower drain.  Now no water drains out, and we've already check the drain for clogs. It's clear.  We currently have to bucket the water out.. . I'm looking for a good water pump to get them before I move out. I'm not sure if it has a sump pit or anything.. . We don't particularly care if we have to pump it out through a window or anything, as we have a pasture next to us.  I just need something that could pump out the water when it rains.  Preferably something not too expensive but that will still get the job done.. . Note:  This is in Louisiana; lord knows what compelled the people who built this house to build a basement.. . Any suggestions/advice are much appreciated.."

"Everytime I get cold, I get an itchy rash that looks alot like hives. The rash is mostly on my hands and wrists, ear lobes, thighs, and feet. Only once was it over my entire body including my face. It just started when I moved into my sisters house after the hurricane, mine was flooded. I thought I was allergic to something in her house, but now that I've moved out, it's still happening. I'm now living in a fema trailer outside the house, but I don't think its anything in the air here since it started happening before I moved back home. I'm using all the same products and eating the same foods that I've always eaten, so it couldn't be any of those things. In fact, I've never been allergic to anything before. I've begun to take an over the counter allergy pill or take an aveeno bath when this happens and it clears it up but I would really like to know what is happening here. It seems ridculous to think that I could be allergic to being cold. Does anybody have any ideas or help?."
"My apt flooded last week on tuesday, the maintenance person flooded my apt.! He left the water running?"
"full blast in the bath tub, left for lunch, two hours later, he came back my upstairs and downstairs was flooded!!! The water was in the walls carpet, and ceiling, everywhere!!  Some carpet cleaner guys came and dried up my carpet, they are not mold clean up specialists, although the manager at the apts says they are. The guys say they sprayed some kind of chemical in the walls and ceiling to prevent mold, they didnt remove the carpet on the stairs, that was left wet, and now my apt smells musty. I already told the manager that my stairs were left wet, and she said that the guys would spray something on them and it would be ok, I am getting tired of them telling me everything is ok, what can I do? Who can I contact about this problem because it was the maintenance person fault not mine they should fix the problem, at least hire specialists."
"The idiotic imbecilic morons who live above me flooded my apartment... for THE THIRD TIME! This time, however, no one was home to put buckets down and now all my clothes, my bed, vacuum, and floor are soaking wet with stinking muck water.  The first time they accidentally left the sink running, the second time they accidentally left bath water running while they went for a damn bike ride... not sure the lame excuse this time, but it doesn't matter... you can't accidentally do that three times in a row unless you have a serious mental defect. I know that their rent is subsidized, so they must really be tarcos. UGH! Not what I wanted to come home to after a long day of work. The last time, my landlord took all my trash out (meaning my things that I had to bag up because they were ruined) and said he'd talk to them.. . Should I move out of the apartment?."
ok the plummer came and he state that there was nothing stick in the toilet...so the water is every where i want to make sure that i dont have to pay fot the damage...i will call the office first thing in the morning i will demand either they can pull the carpet or move me to anothet aparatment...i should not have to pay for the damage when all i did was use then bathroom.
"My small, half bathroom flooded last night with water from my washing machine and some sewer water.  The main sewer line was plugged.  We used a wet vac to get the water up very quickly and wiped down the floor with Colorox wipes.  Will we need to use a dehumidifier?  The plumbers came today and cleared the clog.  Some duct work under the house will have to be replaced too because water got in it.  Should I be concerned about mold too? Is this covered under my home owners insurance?  I know, lots of questions.  I've never had this happen before, so I want to make sure we are taking care of things properly.."

handicap dorm room = level showers = flooded bathroom...what do we do?
"our bathroom is relatively big and our shower is nice but usually you step into a shower as opposed to just walk straight into a shower and so there's no elevation or any type of ""step up"" deal or whatever...the shower drain and everything is level to the ground and therefore when we shower it floods the entire room. . . We are planning on buying something to place by the shower so the water will hit that and go back and inevitably drain down as opposed to flood the entire room...what can we buy?. . did this make sense? lol....."

My roommate says since its water and the floor is tile that we should just let the water evaporate, is this ok to do ?

Currently the stairs, landing and both bedrooms have matching cream carpet and the bathroom has wood laminate.

"Okay, this dream is really weird, and I don't know what it means, but if anyone has any idea, please let me know what it means. Haha.. It's kind of pointless. I'm just curious. :D. . I had a dream that I was in the bathroom using my sink, and I had the stereo plugged in next to the sink, and I guess I left, and came back and the sink was just about to flood and I was too late to turn off the water and everything started electrifying :o and then my room and bathroom flooded.... . ..Then I tried to clean it up :o."

I came across a flooded bathroom with warm water that flooded over the toilet and I thought ""If I go here then it wont go into the toilet it will just go into the water"" but I was so desperate that I decided I didn't care so I went anyway. I woke up and I was going to the bathroom in my bed.. . I do realize it was probably because I needed to use the facilities but the thing I'm getting at is why was the bathroom flooded with warm water? and why was I in a club? . that was completely irrational.."
Can't Figure Out A Dream About A Star That I Had! Please Help!?
"Ok. I had a very strange dream about a singer. Its really confusing. I wanna know if you think he could have had it to.. . I dreamed that i was kidnapped by two men. They forced me to get a job as a waitress in a really fancy hotel. One day the star's band had a concert there and i was ruining late for work and had to change clothes there. After i got there the woman's bathroom flooded. This girl i don't know pulled me to this master sweet. I was changing clothes in the room and Billy Ray Cyrus came in there. he said he was the body guard and he told me to finish changing in the bathroom of the room. (I had off only my shirt. When I was in the bathroom the windows were open and i saw Joe Jonas running towards the room. He was being chased by fans. He came into the room and opened the bathroom door. I said, ""Don't u knock"" and he just stood there staring at my face. I woke up.. . The day before that, I had a dream that i was dieing in a dr's office. The Jo bro's came to see me. When I got better, Nick Jonas took me on a bus on tour with him. Joe knew it was me in the bathroom. . Two days after the last dream, i dreamed Nick found me working and he grabed my arms and kissed me. Then took me to his room and begged me to come with him. I finally said yes and woke up. . Am i just crazy or what. I have dreams of being kidnapped and nick rescuing me all the time by  why Joe that one time. Do you think Joe and I could have shared the same dream. I no I'm crazy in love with Nick But no mean commets please.."
"Why do I keep dreaming about things, then they happen the next day?"
"I usually have very strange, long and detailed dreams. Does anyone have any idea what this one means? . . The first part; I was Harry Potter (but no magic was done during the dream) and I was with Ron Weasley and his father and we were working late at night and early into the morning. We were doing some kind of hard labor, but I remember feeling very masculine after this part. As Ron and I were leaving, we got into a car and the character of Ron turned into someone else. (During my dreams, I usually have one other person that's always with me, but this person constantly evolves into different people). He turned into guy with shaggy dark hair and was driving, whereas I was in the backseat. We were driving through the city and a huge dragon started chasing us. This dragon had human hands and it was reading through the windows, grabbing onto the driver's wrists. The hands had black nail polish. I was reaching up front, trying to pry them off, but I didn't know what to do. I remember vaguely wondering why I didn't have a wand or I couldn't do magic. Then the dragon finally released his wrists because we went under a crumbling overpass into a body of water. We got out of the car and hid under the surface of the water and the dragon couldn't find us. When I came up, the person with me was Hermione Granger now. . . Then my dream shifted and I was at a super huge dark movie theatre. (A reoccurring element in many of my dreams). I left to go to the bathroom and it was huge and both males and females went in to use it. The toilets weer all open and they were just holes on huge benches with padding to sit on. I was wearing my bathing suit and I remember feeling very uncomfortable during this time. I took a long time and couldn't go because there were so many people around. It was no privacy. Then I left to meet my ex-boyfriend outside, and suddenly we were at a rest stop area. We started driving with my dad and his girlfriend and I do not remember seeing my ex again, but there was someone else sitting beside me. We were driving along the beachroad and at one point, there was my friend's car (the one she left me to watch while she went to another state. I do not like taking care of this car, nor can I use it, and I don't really like her either). We were driving toward it because I was going to get in and drive it before the flood came. This huge wave was coming and we were about to make it but we had to turn and leave to higher ground before the water came. We returned later and everything else was washed away, but her car was left, as well as the concrete it was parked on. I tried driving it, but the engine was flooded and would roll but not start up. . . I often have dreams about floods but they never hurt me and I do not fear them. Their just... coming. And I have to get out of the way, but if the flood reaches me, it isn't harsh. It's gentle water around me. . . ?_? Any ideas. I have dreams like this almost every night. I just don't know how to interpret them.."
"I had a dream this morning that I walked into my room and it everything was soaking wet, like the room had been flooded. Also, one piece of furniture was moved, just one. I stepped out of the room and looked over to the bathroom, and I could see what looked like a little boy just behind the shower curtain in the bathtub, like some kind of scary movie. I have seen him once before in a dream, so this is the second time he has appeared. Weird, but is it possible to have a dream ghost?."
"I went to this party with my sister and these girls downstairs in the basement are breaking up their weed so I pulled mine out to match, but it wasn't good enough. So we're downstairs talking normally and some dude's dad came down and kicked us out, so his son left and wouldn't come back. So we're all standing outside on a corner and the dad comes out and offers to pay me and my sister to get his son back. Anyway, we go back inside, and I go through the kitchen and see a little thing of varnish. So I looked at the furniture to see what it was being used for, but nothing looked shiny except one part of the counter. So after we leave the party, soemone is trying to hurt me and my family, and end up driving this car away from him and I noticed that I had excellent control over the it (usually in my dreams I weave all over the road). So I escape this person and try to talk to the cops, and I see two cop cars but when I wave at them, they keep going.. At the end of the dream, I was on a city bus, and the father of the dude who hosted the party and his wife were there with their two year old son, and he was extremely intelligent. So I look across the aisle and I see my girlfriend smile real big and kiss the two year old (in a way anyone would kiss their kid or sibling) and all of a sudden I got filled with hate for her and turned to my window and ignored her.. . . And at some point in this dream I went into a bathroom with a flooded toilet, pee and toilet paper in the seat, and pee all over the floor.. And after I woke up, I went back to sleep and saw the same bathroom, clean, except with poop in the toilet.. . Oh and I was supposed to give a dog a little snack to get through a door, but I gave him a peppermint, and he really liked it!. No, I didn't pee on the floor. The floor was covered in pee when I got there. I saw the nasty bathroom and left. Nothing bothers me more than a gross bathroom.. I have not smoked marijuana for over a week.."

And he didn't respond, so I was like.... calling him and calling him and calling him and calling him. and finally he answered and was like I don't want to talk to you and I was like what did I do? And he was like you're so young, and you never go to school. and I was like but I am on Tuesday, I swear I'll change and he was like you're so immature.. And I was downtown in my town, crying (only it didn't look the same) and I was screaming at him on the phone i was like NO JAMIE NO NO NO JAMIE JAMIE I LOVE YOU JAMIE JAMIE. and then i awoke..  In the second one, I was at the farmhouse again, and Britt(my best friend and ex) and I shared a room and we were getting ready for school and we almost missed the bus, I don't really remember it. But I remember just like cleaning and living there..  . In the third one,Farmhouse again, Britt was cleaning the kitchen, like mopping and stuff and then my mom took us somewhere in a van. only went all crazy and like, was spinning around in the yard and she like tipped it and smashed my arm under the van against the ground, and and then i went inside to shower. and i looked in the drawer and jamies clothes were still there so i was sad, then i grabbed mine. but brooklyn( my cousin) flooded the bathroom all over my clean clothes and i was furious.. and i dont really remember the rest.. . .

"I dreamt i was in my bathroom. It was flooded with ankle deep water and my girlfriend was sat on the edge of the bath laughing at something. All the taps were running, but neither of us turned them off. The weird part though is that i was aware i wasn't an adult, i was about fourteen or fifteen.. I also remember a plane flying past the window and we said something about it. Any ideas????. What you've said gave me goosebumps... I have been acting irresponsibly and i have been avoiding a deadline for some work. I love my girlfriend, but there is a kinda 'unsaid' feeling that we're growing apart (she's growing up, i'm not)...."
"In my dream, my son was upset with me and avoided me all day long. Which isn't anything new. He does this and then he gets over it and comes to me to talk. So in my dream he got over it and then came up to me. I gave him a tooth brush to brush his teeth. He took it and once he did, his teeth began to bleed. With each stroke, more blood came flowing out of his mouth. . . Another part of my dream I went into my house, it didn't look anything like my real house. It was a lot bigger. Anyway, I went upstairs to take a bath but the whole bathroom was flooded. . . What does all of this mean? Thanks."

"Well I remember it plain and clear, most of it anyway. I was in my room and then I walked out into the hallway and then I noticed the walls swelling up with water, I poked at it and then it started leaking, and then my stepfather walked into the hallway and said you shouldn't have done that. Then I proceeded to follow him and then I saw the bathroom tub and noticed the shower head was filling the tub up with water, I turned the shower head to the right for some odd reason, and before I knew it the water was getting too close to this power-strip and I saw it and I was like oh damn and I tried to run out of there before the water got too close to it, but it was too late apparently the water was all over the floor, and then I proceeded to get electrocuted and I felt my whole body shaking like crazy and then I woke up.. . Idk if it has to do something with my left ear lately because of the fact I had recently got tinnitus from too much dark ear-wax and I'm still recovering from it, and plus the fact I have been having emotional problems related to love/sexual stuff. I'm single man, always have been, that was my guess at this interpretation. What do you all think it is?. ...."
"a disaster? LIke I had a dream that I just woke up in my dream, and walked to the park here in my apt. complex, and then my crush was there, running around. He sat down, and I passed by him, he ignored me. And then he started running again this time, beside me, then went ahead of me, and then I bumped into him. I asked, ""What happened here?"" because everything was ruined, and some things were covered. ""Tornado"" he said, but here in Concord, we don't have tornadoes. And we went to my house, and in the bathroom, there was the other boy that i like, standing in the bathtub... and then I asked my crush if he wanted to rest here in my apt (But it was like my own house for some reason) and then he said sure, and laid down on the bathroom floor??. . A lot of my dreams don't make sense, but apparently I had a vision thing in my dream of what was happening while I was apparently asleep, a huge tsunami came over all the buildings, and ruined almost everything, and killed a lot of people, and it happened to all of New Hampshire. . . But then later on in my dream, a bunch of the kids from my gym class suddenly lived in my complex, and everything went back to normal, my dad living in Plymouth, my mom and stepdad were alive, but there were still some confusing things. And I went to school and stuff, but what does it mean when you dream of the first part of the dream? Specifically Floods, natural disasters??. Well the guy i like is dating someone, and I've been really really jealous of that girl lately. As in very jealous because I'm in love with him, but he doesn't act like they're bf and gf. But I've been really mad about that and there are things and ppl that are making me mad lately.."

I was instantly was grabbed up by a safety boat when I looked back I could see his form under the water. The boat quickly sped off leaving him behind. I went back to our house and waited and waited and waited. I was convinced he was Okay for a while . . that was until the News came on with reports of the incident and his name (though misspelled) was on the list. I lost my sh*t! I called his cell and someone else had the number. I was upset and yet everyone around me seemed to be fine or act like I was crazy. No one would go and pick up his things from his job, which had now relocated. So I went with a friend of mine. We were walking to the lockers when I saw my guy walk out of the bathroom and sign out of his job. I was floored! I had run into an old friend of mine and took her hand and dwalked up to him. He said casually ""Hey"" and I said ""Uh uh"" I put her hand in his and asked ""Do you feel this?"" and she said ""Yeah"" Then I jumped into his arms and cried. I looked up death in a dream dictionary and it said that it meant the end of something. But I don't know what it means when the person comes back. Or if he even was dead, I didn't get to look at him so . . . ."
What does it mean you dream of water all the time?
"My dreams always involve water. And it's always in sepia tones...and I get the whole creepy vibe. Like scared. After hurricane Ike I had a dream that I lived in this two story house in the country and that I was looking out the bathroom window (which happened to be flooded) and it was raining and the entire lawn was flooded with murky looking water. I also had a dream that my grandmother's house was completely flooded by nasty light brown water with some stuff floating in it. It looked like rotten plants. . . I want the psychological meaning, not the dream dictionary written by a woman in a turban...please? . Seriously, it's getting annoying. I dream about water every single day. I don't even want to drink water so that I won't have to see it...except it happens to be my favorite drink. . And no, I don't need to go to the bathroom when I'm sleeping.."
I had a dream I was peeing on the toilet and...?
I felt a little bit of urine flood out into my bed. I've never had a problem like this! Is this normal in any way? I was just dreaming that I was using the bathroom And urinated a bit. HELP?.
"I had this weird dream last night. (Kind of long, brace yourself.) :. You should now that throughout the dream I kept changing from a boy to a girl. It wasn't a physical change, it was just that sometimes I felt more masculine and other times I felt more feminine.. .  Anyways, it started out I was hiding in front of the house next door to my grandma's house. I was hiding behind this bush and an indian comes over to me and tells me that Captain Hook is coming to get me and he can see me. .  I look over and here comes Captain Hook, except he has two hands, no hook. When he captures me, I'm a boy. He takes me inside my grandma's house and my whole family is there. I find my mom and give her a hug, and I'm a girl again..   Captain Hook takes me to this secret passage way, and its this huge castle hallway, but it's flooded. I'm a boy again. .  This black horse names Jack is following us over to the end of the hallway, and his saddle is on backyards. Suddenly, all of my friends find the secret hallway and start swimming in it. Captain Hook gets mad and tells me to go to the room at the end and find the bathroom. .  I go inside and it is a circular room with a throne in the middle. I sit down and press a button that says bathroom, and then the walls move and reveal a door. My friends follow me inside, even though I tell them not to and inside is a control room. They start touching everything, and I get so mad I kick them all out..   Now I am a girl again. There is a couch and there are two girls sitting on the couch. The three of us are high school students and we're the preppy girls who wear skinny jeans and bows in our hair. And Shia LaBeouf is sitting on the floor and he starts talking like he goes to school to us and we're all friends. .   Actually, turns out I am his best friend. We're watching some show on the television, and I can hear the other girls thoughts. But they are continuous thoughts: ""I hope he likes me!"".  The two girls have a crush on them, but I don't. Shia and me are joking around, and since I'm sitting behind him I put my feet up on his shoulders and start giving him a massage with my feet. The rest of the dream is just the rest of us hanging out with him. . .   Sorry it's so long, but it's so wierd? What does this all mean?. Especially with Captain Hook, the horse, and me changing from a boy to a girl???."
What does it mean when you dream of your bullies?
"Will anyone tell me what my dream means? Thanks, love you!?"
"At the start of this strange dream, i joined a Secret Fraternal organization, much like the Freemasons but fotwomen only.. My family went to Japan on a vacation, we went to Tokyo.. We visited a water park place near the sea and ate some food. Everybody in the park was eating because it was lunch time. Then a big tidal wave hit the park and it was flooded. People were on ""Isles"" (Roofs and higher places around the park) and i lost my family and swam in the water to find other people and i found this man, i think he was a bit crazy and he kept telling me to shut up whenever i spoke. We searched for somewhere else and found the bathroom and many other people. The guy said that he would ""Kill Me"" and i told everybody that i am leaving, he said ""No!, we should all stay together"". Then some guy came and told me to follow him, he took me to the entrance/exit and i left the park. I was the first to leave and a Shintoist priest done a ritual on me.. I was walking back to the hotel and some people attacked me, the guy who helped me escape the park came and then i woke up.."
"I had this strange dream just a few hours ago, it was very vivid and clear and felt like it was truly happening:. . Well, it started out with myself in a bathroom and my parents was there when the bathroom suddenly started to flood.. . Next, everything started to become blurry and I felt dizzy and then I think I fainted/lost consciousness. I could then feel myself 'rising' from the ground... I could literally feel myself 'floating' higher and higher.. . I consciously was thinking that I must be dying.. . My vision must have regained and I was now outside, flying above what seemed like a town. I was looking down at this town whilst 'flying' or 'floating' .. I specifically remember the vividness of the green grass, and I remember seeing one man looking up at me. . . While this was happening I remember thinking that I must be dead and I was hoping that nothing scary would happen... . I then seemed to have floated back down and was standing at a road corner. And then I woke up.... . =/. . (I've never, from what I remember, experienced a dream where I was actually 'thinking'...)."
how do I keep the bathroom floor dry when my husband floods it with water everyday?
"I keep those two dollar cheap, colorful absorbent mats but they seem to get soaked n' start stinking.  Any other ways on keeping the bathroom floor dry?  Is there any other aborsbent mat someone can vouch for? Or should I keep replacing the mats every couple of days by washing n' drying?."
I spilled latex semi gloss paint on tile bathroom floor and how wood louvre cabinet front. How do I remove it?
"About an hour ago, a quart fell off counter and  down the louvred door of the sink cabinet, and onto tile floor.  How do I get it all off?  I scooped as much as I could, wiped with newspapers, flooded the floor, rubbing, using a floor vac. Now there is still a whitewash glaze over the floor, I'm keepingit wet till I get some answers!  There is paint in the grout.  should I use a razor blade ? or will this scratch grout and tiles?  should I think about sanding the varnished (and now paint splattered) louvres and re-varnishing.  Or would it be easier to just buy a new one (then varnish it. )Hoping for the most efficient way to go about this, since I STILL have to buy new paint and paint the bathroom! . thanks in advance.. I also have a 'dremmel' tool with a huge kit of attachments.  Is there something in there that would help with getting the paint out of the grout or the faint white glaze off  of the tiles?."
Why is there water always all over the floor in muslim countries?
"My wife is Asian and where she comes from they have it set up cool where the light at top is hot and evaporates water, and the floor has a drain. . . I love her to death but when she's in the bathroom she thinks she's a f@#cking Sea Otter or Black Labrador or something and by the time she's finished the place looks like it's been wiped out by a biblical flood. . . . We have bathroom mats but they hold onto wetness and don't really let it go. Should I install a floor drain or is there any easier route to go? Last time I tried to make a ""improvement"" on my house it ended, badly.."
"Okay, so my toilet overflowed when I flushed and flooded my bathroom floor. There was seriously about an inch of water covering the floor. I have already tried plunging it and trying to clear it out with baking soda and vinegar and it still overflowed, flooding my washroom again. Any ideas of what to do next. Please do not tell me to call a plumber. I know this would be the best option but I am a university student and therefore poor.."
"So I came home this afternoon and not only was my basement bathroom floor flooded, but the bathtub AND toilet were full of brown water. What is going on!."
"My bathroom flooded and now the whole apartment stinks of wet floor.   How do I get the smell out?   I've already wiped the floor and floorboards down with Clorox.   There wasn't any sewage involved, but my tub's drain caused the toilet to overflow.."
I would like to know if it is safe to be standing in water that has come from the washer after it had flooded the bathroom floor? The drier(electric) was running also while we were mopping up the water with heavy towels.. These people were standing in a lot of water while both appliances were running. So my question is: What are the safety percautions that should have been taken?.
"whenever I have a shower the bathroom floods. we have a drain on the bathroom floor so I think the water goes down the drain in the shower and is coming up through the other drain :/ it was pretty bad last night, the water almost went out the door. the shower is in the same room as the bathroom."
What would you do if you used the toilet at someone's party and the commode backed up and flooded with waste?
"This really happened at a place of business. Someone used the bathroom, the toilet backed up and flooded the floor with sewage. They had to call a cleaning crew and plumber to fix it. how embarassing!."
People who get out of the shower and splash water all over the floor?
"My husband complains, and I have to agree, when people stay overnight, someone always seems to flood the bathroom floor.  I know it's neither of us as we are both always the last to use the shower out of consideration and we always dry ourselves inside as we have a shower recess nearly the size of the bathroom itself, but it happens every time.  The bath mats are soaking wet and you're just trying to keep your feet dry, particularly annoying in the cooler weather.  Anyone of you ever experience the same discomfort?. Thanks ahead for any answers!. The shower in the main bathroom is completely sealed.  We only recently had the seals replaced at the cost of a small fortune so that's not the problem.  And there are sliding doors in the shower, not curtains.. And 'Yes' we use bath mats.....that's what's irritating.."

"I cam home to my apartment to a flooded bathroom floor a couple days ago..not terribly flooded but like the area around the toilet. It's not coming from the toilet itself but underneath it whenever I flush, and the toilet seems to run constantly. Any idea why? Or how I could fix this?."
Should a bathroom floor be caulked around the edges to create a waterproof barrier?
"We are doing a self remodel of our house. We put new linoleum down in the bathroom and new trim. My husband thinks that caulking the top of the trim to the wall is all it needs and I say it needs to be caulked around the bottom. That way no moisture from the bathroom can get underneath the tiny crack and cause damage to the wall underneath. Can someone please back me up on this? It has caused quite a shouting match this morning and it would be great to have him see someone else's opinion. Our house is in a flood zone too, by the way, the reason for our remodel is a flood. It is going to be caulked no matter what, but I would really like to tell him I am right.."

"How do I clean the ""mold"" from my bathroom wall?"

"My shower recently backed up and flooded my bathroom.  I thought my management company cleaned it because the day after, they had gone into my apartment and it smelled like cleaning products and everything was dry again.  Now a few days later, it definitely does not smell like cleaning products any longer, which leads me to believe they just kind of mopped things up.  . . So...what kind of cleaning products should I use to make the smell go away and to make sure that the shower and bathroom floors are sanitized?  And I'm kind of new at this whole house cleaning thing, so also, I basically have a sponge, should I be using that or should I get some kind of mop that will work just as well?."
We have hardwood floor in our bathroom. I laid down sticky tiles. Recently our toilet broke and flooded the floor. Now the floor stinks that moldy mildew smell. What can I use to disinfect and get rid of the smell. I was going to use bleach but I don't know if that will eat away at the floor..
Is there a way to get water out from under a cabinet without moving it or cracks in the floor?

Can anybody help me with ways to unclog a pipe?
"My washer and downstairs toilet drain into the same pipe.  I was doing laundry this morning and the washer drained its water, and it backed up into the toilet and flooded the bathroom.  While investigating i noticed that the toilet, when flushed would drain really slow, so I figured there is a back up somewhere down the line past where the washer and where the toilet connect to the bigger drain pipe. Is there a way I can clear the blockage myself or should i call a professional.  Thanks!."

"I have taken a lot of advice on how to flood-protect my home, including using a lime-based plaster on the walls.  Would bathroom paint (in the downstairs rooms) help the resilience of the property?."
"I need help trying to figure out how to get my toilet to stop filling. After a flush, the tank start filling and wont stop. And it floods my bathroom. It is to the point that you have to turn the water on to fill it and flush it, then turn it off when it's full again. Otherwise....flood. Most toilets have that air filled ball in the back. This one doesn't. It has a plastic drum... I don't know what to make of it or how to get it to stop. So if anyone has any ideas, I would appreciate it very much. Thanks and Happy Holidays!."

"I live in a condo complex. The sink in the bathroom overflowed and flooded my bathroom as well as the condo below. I talked to the water damage guy and he says my insurance covers my damages & the insurance of the guy below covers his. Is this true?. My repairs are minimal, so I did not report it to the insurance. Also I have the regular condo insurance not sure if it covers this kind of flooding. Please advise."
I live in a condo that had a small flood in the bathroom recently from a leaking drain pipe. I lost my photos of the damages. I was able to take more photos but I do not have the originals. I did not do any repairs except paint the bathroom cabinet. I normally would not have done this but I did not think my home owner's insurance would cover the damages. Will the bathroom cabinet be discounted from the insurance claim or will the inspector take into account the cabinet was part of the flooded area?.

"I live at apartments across from the UT Austin Campus in Texas. About two hours ago, my apartment started flooding with water. Apparently, my friend on the fourth floor was using his sprinkler as a hanger for his clothes. Water started pouring down in my bathroom vents and in my walls. The entire apartment got about an inch of water before the fire department got here. This is the third time my apartment has flooded within four months. . . The first time it flooded, was when we first moved in, and the management did not plug the washing machine in, so when I turned it on; it flooded. The second time, for some unknown reason my bathroom flooded.. . I do not have renter's insurance, but I would like something done. I was hoping I could get cheaper rent, or have the management move my roommates and I into another apartment building; as I fear mold, mildew, and electrical problems. What are the odds of me getting this?. . Is there anything else they can do? I am pretty sure, they are not liable for anything according to the lease, but I just really do not want to live in this apartment for the rest of the school year.."
"How can I go about suing an insurance company for denying to pay for a claim that they said is not covered but I believe is? I live in a condo.  A pipe burst in the building somewhere and ended up flooding my two bathrooms because water came up through the shower drains and toilets and ended up causing water damage to the carpets in the adjacent bedrooms from the spillage.  They are claiming that there is an exclusion in the policy stating that they don't cover water damage that comes from sewer backup, drains, or sump pump.  Do I have a case?."
I live in a condo. my master bedroom got flooded from water damage caused by water coming out of the shower?
"I live in a condo.  my master bedroom got flooded from water damage caused by water coming out of the shower drain and toilet.  My insurance decided that they will not cover it because of an eclusion in the policy stated they don't cover water damage caused by sewer backup or drain backup.  The problem happened when the pipe in the building somewhere burst.  They called the plumbers.  Plumbers turned off the water.  when they were finished, they turned the water back on and all the water started flooding in my bathroom and into the bedroom. They turned the water back off  and rotted out the drain or pipe in the building and found a lot of junk that somebody had flushed down the toilet and they said that this was the cause for the flooding in my unit.  So my insurance isn't covering it.  Who should I go after now?  Should i go after my condo association or go after the plumbers who came to work on the problem?  Or should I sue my insurance company.  somebody has to pay!! and it's not going to be me!!."
"I am looking for any Information about mold and mildew.  I have a friend who had their bathroom flood.  The insurance co first said to gut the bathroom and start over.  Now they called in Service Pro and said only replace the particle board.  I know some of the water got into the lower part of the walls and rooms next to the bathroom.   I might need to add that the water came from a broken HOT water line.  Any information with links would be most helpful.  My friend is supposed to meet with his adjuster, Service Pro and a contractor this afternoon.  I think my friend needs more information before having this meeting.  Thank you.."
Right we left the tap on in the Bathroom and it flooded and brought the ceiling down on the kitchen! The insurance company wants a plumbers report to say the tap was actually on to pay out. How much odes this cost? Any plumbers do it for cheap there is nothing wrong with the plumbing just need the report. Well yes i am a retard obviously - just an accident in which the tapo was left on with the plug. Loss adjuster came out and asked for plumbers report. Explained etc etc we are covered for accidental damge hence them paying out for my stupidity - but was told to get the report before they pay out.
Will Insurance company pay for new subfloor? what else will they pay for? Water Damage?
I had a flood and it was my fault because of my dog. What am I responsible for?
My apartment was flooded by my dog chewing on a water pipe in the bathroom when i was at work. I came home and my apartment had been flooded as well as the one beneath me. The neighbor below me lost a few items. I do not have renters insurance and she does not have renters insurance. I have to cover the costs of the constant fans and dehumidifiers in both apartments and the fixing of the cracked ceiling beneath me. Will I be responsible for her items that she lost during the freak accident that was my dogs fault?.

Sewage in the basement. What to do when cleaning up?
"My basement recently flooded when the sewers backed up through our basement bathroom.  Per the insurance company and health department, nearly everything that got wet with raw sewage must be thrown away.. .

If I work at an apartment community and while working I accidentally flooded an apartment. Am I responsible?
"I work as a leasing agent at an apartment community and while cleaning an apartment one day the water was shut off to the entire property during my time cleaning the apartment.  I left a knob turned on in the bathroom sink and when the water came back on it flooded the apartment I was cleaning as well as the one below. Now my property manager wants to ""charge"" me for it, and instead of making me pay cash, I am being asked to do odd jobs on my days off, things such as sign spinning and cleaning apartments and I repeat....ON MY DAYS OFF. . . I am wondering if this is illegal or wrong in any manner.  I am sure that there is some type of insurance that pays for these types of accidents and not only am I being asked to pay it back but work without pay. . . I need some advice before I agree to follow what I believe is wrong.."
"A pipe burst in the bathroom causing a flood in the apartment I rented, unable to inhabit...should I pay rent?"
I have discovered I have damp and had a builder out today for an estimate. We said it was partly coming from a leak we had in the bathroom and partly water coming from outside. I have spoke to the insurance company before I got the builder round and they said it would be covered as the damage was resulting from a leak. . . However now that he has found some of the damp is coming from outside so you think I will still be covered? I cannot see anything in the policy booklet about damp except for damage resulting from a storm or flood is covered. . . ll send the insurance company the estimate when it arrives but in the meantime does anyone if they are likely to cover it?.

Can't use our toilet or shower for several days. Black water keeps on flooding the bathroom. Compensation?
"We can't use our bathroom because due to construction that's happening across the street or some other factor, black water shoots up randomly from both the shower and toilet and floods our bathroom and kitchen beside it. there was no warning, it just started happening randomly. The landlord said he'll call the city tomorrow, but who knows how long that will take to fix. . . How should i pursue to get compensation for this?

How can I keep the bottom of my furniture from being damaged by in home flooding?
"My bedroom is in our basement, along with a kitchen and bathroom. There hasn't been a problem until last week when our septic system backed up through my bathroom.

My On-campus apartment was flooded due to the rain. Can i cancel or break my lease?
"Last year, my mom hired a contractor to make a few updates to our kitchen and bathroom. The thing is, he messed every single thing up. When he installed a new kitchen countertop, he ended up sawing off a chunk of our wall. The stove is now at an angle tilting from the wall so that when my mom puts a pot on one of the four surface elements, it ends up sliding maybe half an inch forward every five minutes so she has to constantly keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't slide off and crash onto the floor. The sink leaks into the cabinet and into the basement wall below.. The contractor also forgot to turn off the water supply to the house when he installed a new toilet in the first floor bathroom and half of the basement flooded. Everything in the laundry room, library, and bathroom in the basement got soaked. . My mom was so distressed after this that she didn't want to deal with it anymore so she didn't report him to NJ Consumer Affairs. Is it too late to do anything about this now?."
"We had a little flash flood here. I just finally managed to get the water out of the patio by sweeping it with a kitchen broom (my wrists, owww). But the water came up so quick that is still seeped through the kitchen and into the bathroom (which is on that side of the house). I've sopped up the water as best as I could (I can't move the washer and dryer), and I put the fan in the bathroom to try and dry it. I have no idea what to do. My mom is at work and isn't answering her phone. I know she's afraid the linoleum in the kitchen and the bathroom will come up and the floor boards underneath will rot.. Does anyone have any suggestions for what I can do? I'm at a loss.."
Okay let me first say that Friday my old water heater flooded the kitchen I installed a new one and now water leaks out of the faucets in the kitchen sink and bathroom sink and tub. What's wrong why is that happening?. . I turned the the temperature today because my wife's bath water turned brown (rust from old piping I believe).
"Where can I find drinking water when my town is flooded, and the city water is off?"
"god sent the flood and saved noah, and then gave us the rainbow to show sinners that he wouldnt flood us again. he made a PROMISE!. this morning I came to find Jayden had been playing in the bath and ran the taps and they had gone past the overflow and the cieling of the kitchen was like raining! I had made caekes for the local bake sale and I ALWAYS win that cake competition. why would god do this to me? I am a good christian mother!."
"My family has temporarily moved into an economy lodge for the sake of flood damage to our home. What are some things I can do to make this run-down place a little more home-like so things aren't so bad?. . It has a tiny kitchen & bathroom, table & chairs, love seat & tv and a queen sized bed. ."

"I had a dream last night that me and my best friend went to a chorus concert at her school (I don't go to her school), and we were on stage, and the curtains opened, and we were singing Amazing Grace, but then I forgot the lyrics, so we had to start over, and when we started over, we started singing, and then the front of the stage caught on fire. At first we didn't do anything about it, but I didn't want the fire to spread and harm us, so we went off the stage through the back door, and somehow, it took us to this tattoo parlor, and then my best friend really had to pee, so we went down to the bathroom, and it was all like, flooded with dirty water. Like, with pine needles and stuff in it, and on the door frame and all over the wall of the bathroom, was pictures of us,growing up together, and we were looking at them, and then it ended. Does this mean anything?. I KNOW it means something, because it involved fire, and random pictures of us, and the dirty water. These were things I noticed the most in the dream. The things that stood out most. So I know it means something. Just don't know what.."

"I made this poem, about a month and half ago, and I was meaning to put it up but never did. Well, here it is. [It's kind of depressing though...]. . No Turning Back . . Walking in a straight line, . Head down, hands in my pocket, . Thinking it will be just fine, . Knowing it?s a lie makes it worse. . . Constant glares that burn through my flesh,. Leaves sears where old ones have healed, . All I want is to begin anew, to start fresh, . Make it so no one knows whom I was.. . Losing my footing I topple onto the cold tile,. Books are sent airborne, laughs are audible,. Worthless materials are now strewn in a pile.. Quickly gathering the possessions, I close my eyes,. But all I can picture are my final goodbyes.  . . Running hastily towards the bathroom stalls, . My eyes halfway flooded by tears,. I find safety behind these four concrete walls,. Waiting, just waiting, for my memories to erase. . . I find myself standing on the edge of a cliff, . One foot off, one foot on. . Looking down at the bottomless abyss, . My limbs become frozen stiff. . . I close my eyes for just a minute,. Breathe in single breath after another.. Waiting for my world to become mute. . Only to be halted by a familiar hand on my shoulder. . . It?s the hand of a friend, a loving face,. Spots the tears pooling in my eyes,. Searches for the light in my heart that I try to erase,. And says, ?There?s still time.?."
"This is about as close to illegal as she can get without crossing the line! She brought a realtor in under the guise of a ""friend"" who was to look at my rotting bathroom wall and kitchen floors who then took pictures, put up a sign and ta-da...house for sale! She refuses to fix the issues, will not reduce rent, and now refuses to return calls, letters (both regular and certified) as well as e-mails. I really cannot afford to go to court....all I really want to know is if the realtor can be asked to not take prospective buyers into my personal bedroom......this is a nightmare! They ask me to leave to show it, and want my dog to be removed as well.....I feel very violated inlieuu of all that hasoccurredd. Mind you, we moved into this rental in an emergent situation out of desperation since we had just lost everything to adevastatingg mudslide and flooding. Can I request they remove the pictures of the inside of the house posted all over the internet seeing that all of MYpossessionss are nowvisiblee to any idiot who wants to know what goods we have to potentially rip off? Can I request that they not take clients into ONE room...MY personal bedroom (no master suite or anything, just a damn bedroom)? Is this ok, do I have any rights in this situation? I believe I pay for my privacy here......hmmm. thanks....i got an attorney. Alot of the advice i recieved here was blunt, rude and innacurate! I am no loser or jerk.......i understand she has a right to sell. I am not stupid either. Yes, she has violated my rights under oregon statute.

Can my landlord charge me for laminate floor damage after I've moved out?
Do you think this house would be a good investment?
What do you think of the beginning of my story?
Tell me if you like my story (All criticism is appreciated)?
"So yeah; what do you think? :). Thankyou! :D. . The old, wooden door creaked open and Sir Porter stode into the classroom. His face, grimmer than usual, had an unusual pallor as he breezed by the students and stopped at Mrs. Ingham's desk. He avoided eye contact with the teacher, who seemed to be shocked at the sudden disruption.                                                                                                                              ""Sir. Porter, why have you just disturbed all my hard-working students?"" Mrs. Ingham asked. Her forehead earned a few more wrinkles as she frowned, tilting her head forwards so she could peer over her glasses at the nervous man.. By my side, Penelope nudged my arm, and I grinned in reply.. ""P-Perhaps we should discuss the situation at hand...Out of earshot, Mrs. Ingham."" The middle-aged man stuttered, and Mrs. Ingham pushed her falling glasses back onto her nose and followed him out of the stone classroom, shutting the door behind her as I noticed Sir. Porters hand begin to tremble.. Gossip erupted through the air, Penelope and Ginger chatting happily as I placed my head down on the wobbly table, last nights worries flooding back to me.. Seconds later, the frail body of Mrs. Ingham hurried back to the front, fingering the hem of her flowery, long-sleeved shirt and taking a sip of water.. ""C-Class, Sir. Porter has received some bad news which we all have to tell our students,"" She mumbled, and the class grew silent, all eyes falling on her. ""This morning, the dead body of Olivia Lockwood was retrieved from Tiger Forest, we don't know how or why, but more information will be given."" She managed to whisper, and everybody turned to stare at each other, and I glanced, shocked, at Penelope.. ""But when we left she was fine!"" I whispered to her, and she bit her nails nervously, staring at what seemed to be nowhere as I shook her shoulders. Her honey blonde hair fell over her pale face.. ""We must of done something, Rimmie. Nobody was with us when we followed her, or talked to her, or left her. Oh God, I'm gonna' get sent down. I can't go to prison, I'm only fourteen, I-"". ""Penelope, please. If you start getting freaked out then I will. But I promise you, we didn't do this."" I soothed, my heart starting to beat as fast as a hummingbirds wings.. I raised my hand in the air, glancing at Mrs. Ingham as she seemed to mutter to herself.. ""Uh...Mrs. Ingham?"" I said, and her head snapped up to mine, and she pulled a fake smile onto her elderly face. ""Please can I go to the bathroom? Nature calls."". She nodded curtly. ""Of course, Rimmie."". I stood up from the plastic chair, ignoring the amused stares which followed me all the way out of the room, and I cut them off harshly by slamming the door shut with accidental force.. As I was aware that the way to the Ladies bathroom was right, but I turned left instead, in search of Katie.. She had to hear about this.. I made my way through the never ending corridors, old pictures hung on every single wall. I knew which class Katie was in, she told me before class, because she had Madam Clemence, who she despised. Nobody liked Madam Clemence, her long, brown hair was always tightly pulled back into a neat bun, and it was extremely difficult not to constantly stare at the huge mole above her lips, which were always moulded into a grim line.. Tapping on the door, I heart Madam Clemence call out to me from inside the classroom, and I peaked my head through, smiling kindly.. ""Mornin' Madam Clemence. Can I borrow Katie for a sec? It seems Jimmy the Tortoise has gone walk-abouts again."" I laughed, my eyes landing on Katie, who's head bowed in embarrassment.. Madan Clemence contemplated for a minute. For a moment, I thought she'd say no, because admittedly, I weren't the best behaved student in the world.. ""Go ahead, but I'm trusting you to not wander off and do something stupid, Rimmie."" . I pushed her warning aside, and hurried Katie out of the cold classroom, pulling her further down the corridor and letting her arm go.. ""Did you hear the news?"" I asked, and she sighed heavily, folding her arms across her chest.. ""What news?"". I hesitated. ""Olivia Lockwood was found dead in the woods this morning."". An eerie silence engulfed us both. As my words sunk in to Katie's head her ocean blue eyes widened and she brushed back her curly brown locks with a quivering hand. My eyes followed her as she sank down to the tiled floor, and hit her head harshly against the wall.. ""We didn't do it, did we, Rimmie?"" She whispered, and she stared up at me.."
Found lots of mold in appt. Can we break lease?
"Here it is, it's not that good and its not got a name. . I just started writing it. . Thanks !. . . . . . As i wake up i agknowledge the fierce curtains swooshing beneath the wind. I don't move a muscle. i stay pencil straight. There was a glass of water on my bedside table that was laying infront of my picture of me and my father. . There, next to the glass of water lay a note for me. It was from mum. . . . Gone at work. . Won't be long. . -Mum. . . No Kisses.. I knew that being a slave was sure to be an awful job. In the times like these there was no other jobs. For one thing i knew for sure was that mum would do anything to stay away from me. I'm not diffucult and i don't plan to be. Sure i get smashed and thrashed and thottled by her. But thats mum for me then isn't it? . Father died in the war. Nothing much to say really. But one thing i knew for sure was that he loved me more than anything. Probably more than my mum. . I do love my mum but she can be a pain and a nuisance. . So finally after dreaming about him i got up. I walked to the bathroom to clean my face. As i walked in i saw my reflection the mirror. I hate mirrors and i hate my reflection. . My brown hair swooped over my face. I reached over and grabbed a ribbon. . I tied my hair and looked into the mirror again. The scars on my face were awful. What had she done to me?. The warm tears flooded down my cheeks. I didn't want to live this way. No one would want to see me. No boy would love me. I would end up bitter and alone and i would NEVER forgive her for this.. I started washing my face. After that i made the broth for lunch. Lentils with leek and other vegetables. Not my favourite but i've got to live with what i've got.."
"The Last Stand. . . . . I ran through a narrow corridor. Lights above blinding. Pure white walls. Glints of colour streaking past my vision. Especially red. This never ending maze. Swift turns. Right. Left. Then right again. A straight. A blue door..            Panic rose within me, and an intoxicating burn spread up the back of my thighs. I pushed the blue door in front of me, and shielded my eyes. What lay before me was my life. Freedom - the very exhilaration that I lived for..            But really it was all that I had. . . I live in the sky, with the wind carrying me. My heels sink into the air itself. I run with the flow of nature, I answer its call. Only really this is the picture I paint for myself. It is what I like to see, when I glance at the steamed mirror in the bathroom. I had often sought advice from the reflective material in my moments of desperation, my moments of hysteria. Somewhere deep inside of me hates what I do. Hates what I stand for. Although the real part of me, the persona that I listen to, tells me to 'keep on running'..  . *. . I set myself up for the penultimate jump, I built up momentum, ran up the side of the wall, continued further until I reached the edge of the skyscraper and ... I was set free. Or at least for that moment I felt as though I was. Then I landed on the adjacent building, rolled in one fluid motion and regained an upright position.. The world      slowed      down for a moment in order for me to catch my breath. I walked to the edge of the building. It was a long jump to the next, in fact for a moment I debated whether it was too far. I soon realised that really it was my nerves eating away at my courage. I moved back and again began running for the jump. Rapid speed, a slight right turn. A leap of faith. Found what I was looking for. Parkour time. A chance to fly through a delicious arc engraved in the air. I built up as much speed as I could, forcing my heels into the ground. A perfect parabola, a sweeping, soaring, selfish moment. I trapezed across a pipe and leaped. . . A new age of dictatorship has taken over. They have flooded the minds of individuals manipulating the ideologies of everyone. I need information on the recent election, I must find out what is going on in this world. If I do not, no one will. . . I landed heavily, when I regained myself I looked to the side of the shimmering building. I could see myself. The real me, the one that hides in the shadows, the one that I dismiss. I touched the glass. I almost felt a connection with myself. Through my stern eyes I could see my true features: my high cheek bones, my small nose, and my slightly parted lips. My complexion soft, but my core equal to a diamond in strength. I took a step back to take myself in, for it was not often that I looked at myself in such detail. Behind my now blurred reflection a yellow door ? my way in. I felt the chrome handle of the door and opened it.. I had studied the blue-prints for the building as usual and had a rough idea of where I was going. I proceeded to the utility room. I lifted my arm to touch the vent hatch on the ceiling. I gripped it and ripped it open, quickly I climbed up. I heard someone coming. I reached down for the flap, but I could not quite catch the edge of it. I heard the door handle click. I still extended my arm, until I caught the tip and pulled it up. As I did this; the door opened, and a man with a blue uniform carrying a firearm walked in. I lay quiet. He surveyed the room; almost mechanically scanning it. When he seemed quite content he turned and left the room.. I continued through the vent until I found the room I was looking for. The vent was positioned behind my target and out of sight. I opened the hatch and slid out. I quickly but silently moved closer to him, in one fluid movement thrust him to the chair.. 'What do you want? What have I done to you!' he said. I drew near to him and pressed myself against him. I whispered in his ear;. 'What happened with the election?'. 'I don't know anything I swear!'. 'I don't think so. If you value your life then you will tell me what I want to know' I said, through gritted teeth. . 'Honestly I don't know, you want to talk to Banks, here I ...'. Banks?

"Okay, so. We had a problem with our upstairs toilet. One day we flushed it and it flooded our entire bathroom. So my grandfather came and looked at it and said the flapper was too light. So, my husband shut of the water to the toilet until we could get a new flapper. When we finally got the new flapper, installed it and the toilet still ain't working. The tank isn't filling anymore. We fill the tank and flush it, but it wont fill back up. And yes, we have turned the water on.... Any ideas on how to fix it?."

Okay so I know I'm a total fucking idiot and I don't deserve a cat. I just tried to dye my cat with manic panic and conditioner and I didn't really think of how i was going to rinse her off. Now I have a flooded bathroom and a pissed off cat because all I could do was chase her around the bathroom with a cup of water. It's mostly off but not completely and she keeps licking herself and I'm scared she's going to get sick. Should I take her to the vet or what the fuck do I do?! . And please I don't need a lecture on what a shitty cat owner I am because I'm aware of this now I need answers fast Dx.
"Buying house, just had pest control, what is difference between drywood and subterranian termites?"
"We just had pest report done on a foreclosure we are thinking of purchasing.  We are aware that it needs cosmetic work (bathroom was flooded due to leak), some drywall issues, etc.  We just received the pest report and found some problems.  The pest report indicates that evidence of subterranian termites were found but no drywood termites.  The report indicates that the subterranian termites were found ONLY under the bathroom on the lower level that was flooded.  The floor needs to be pulled up, and completely replaced.  There was also evidence of subterranian termites on the exterior of the house on the same side as this flooded bathroom (report states termite tubing was found against concrete foundation directly outside this flooded bathroom.. . Now my question..what's the difference between drywood termites (report did not find any evidence) and subterranian termites (evidence found of under previously flooded bathroom).  . . Are subterranian termites serious, and can they spread or would they be centrally located to this area that previously flooded?  The pest report stated most of the crawl space in the middle of the house could not be checked due to lack of space.  We're worried that maybe the entire crawl space/under house could be infested with termites but they could only check certain area's under the house.  . . Weary of continuing with offer on house if it's going to be a serious problem that will be expensive to fix or could cause problems in future.. We live in northern California.."
"I was at this restaurant a while back and I went there frequently. The bathroom consists of three urinals and a stall, so yeah it's public. But I guess the restaurant bathroom flooded one time or something so they had to remove the stall for a little bit. But since the restroom is public, it has no locks on it. So this means anyone could see you on the toilet. Luckily the time I went, it was only me and my brother in the bathroom. He made sure no one came in.. . But what if it were just me alone? Would it be acceptable -or legal- to have no locks on the door with no stall surrounding the toilet? I'm just guessing that someone else might have had to suffer through that incedent.. . PS: The restroom does now have a stall since repairs.."
At what age did you start letting your kids bathe themselves alone?
Our toilet backed up and flooded our bathroom. The water ran into the floor vent and flooded the air ducts. The ducts are insulated. Will the whole duct system have to be replaced? Or can it just be treated to prevent mildew? What do we do?!.
"Will I ever love again, seriously? I swear to god I'm not heartbroken?"
Ok we just got this house a few months a go and today when doing laundry (which is in the basement) flooded our walk in shower that is also in the basement. the shower is not draining and the water is everywhere no sewage but lots of laundry soap. the laundry room which is very small is right next to the bathroom so I am guessing they share the same piping. Any ideas I am not sure what to do at this point other than call a plumber and it is the weekend..
Do you have to turn the cold water on and the hot off. After our well pump was purged . we were told to turn on all fucets. alot of sediment came out. one of the bathrooms flooded bad. What a mess at this hour. What should have been done after the purge.

My landlord has been here several times trying to fix it himself but it obviosuly needs a professional.  Now the landlord either ignores my calls and isnt fixing it. What can I do to make him get a pro to fix it asap.  It's not even livable in here..

my bathtub is flooded and i am surrounded by piranhas and leeches know what?
"My bathtub sprung a leak and the water flooded my brand new carpet in my master closet.  I got a rug doctor to suck up the water but I'm worried about mold since I live in Florida.  Are there any cleaning agents I could use other than bleach to prevent or remove mold.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  I've spent a fortune getting the problem fixed, I cant spend much more.  Should I just rip it out and replace it?  Argh!."

Is the great flood the same as drowning one's children in a bathtub instead of correcting misbehavior itself?

"I'm purchasing rental insurance, can I assume the dwelling is covered by the owner?"
"I understand that I should cover my personal property, personal liability, loss of use, etc., but should I insure the actual dwelling and property against damage or loss? For instance, if the roof fell off, would that fall under MY insurance or the owners? If the bathtub fell through the ceiling and flooded the house, would that fall under my coverage?."
My building's maintenance worker flooded my apartment; now I'm given the run around regarding reimbursement.
"I really need some help. LAST JUNE a maintenance worker came to repair my bathtub. Not only did he break the faucet, but flooded my apartment as well. The water was taken care of, but I have ended up with lots of damages to my personal belongings (carpet, paint, furnishings, etc.). I have tried since then to have the situation remedied, and after months of being ignored and pushed aside was told to make a list of damages with estimated cost to be given to the insurance company, which I promptly did. This was in February. I have tried to contact the office with no response, left messages for the person who is taking care of my issue (I call the office two to three times a week, and she has yet to be working any day I call), and have finally gotten to the end of my rope. What do I do from here? I really don't want to go to small claims court for fear of  having trouble with the building corporation or being evicted, and I don't have renter's insurance. I feel stuck and frustrated.."
What is the best way to get dirty water out of carpets?
"Today I did a load of laundry and the dirty water from the washer started exploding out of the toilette and bathtub. Clearly I need a plumber for that, but my question is, it flooded the floor and I guess seeped through the walls or flooring or something, because in both bedrooms the carpets along the wall are soaking wet. It is brand new carpet, only a month old therefore I don't want it to stink from the dirty water, or get ruined... what do I do!? (besides calling a carpet cleaner)."
"I was standing in the bathtub showering and all of a sudden it started flooding and white stuff that looked like nasal mucus or sperm bubbled out from the plug hole. Now the bath got flooded and I was standing in there. I took some time before getting out of the tub though.. . Now what if I've got cuts on my toes/feet/under feet, can HIV be transmitted this way? Do you think I have contracted HIV?. . Help nurses and doctors!!!. I was showering in a large household shared by strangers.."
"When you were a kid, did you ever fill the bathtub up to the brim and?"

How can I clear water from a drain during a flood?
"Okay, so there's a room in my house that is prone to flooding during severe rain storms, hurricanes, and stuff like that. I tried to buy a water pump, but they were all sold out because of Hurricane Irene. My plan was to run a garden hose from the drain outside, through that room to the bathtub and let the water leave through the bathtub drain. How can I get that to work?."
How do I fix water coming from under the toilet cheaply?
"Everytime I either flush the toilet or shower, water comes from under the toilet, flooding the bathroom and hall, and fills the bathtub.

Is there anything I can do it fix it on my own?."

"Why worship the Christian God, he sounds like a horrible fellow?"
"I ask this question in all seriousness.  The guy screws up his creation project, and instead of snapping his fingers and editing everything, he decides it would be a good idea to DROWN everything on earth.  That would be like me not wanting to breed hamsters anymore and then drowning them all in the bathtub.  Real pleasant God.  But hang on, even before the flood, God comes across as a jerk.  He not only creates humans to be gullible, but he also creates a sneaky SNAKE to trick those humans!  And then he punishes the humans for listening to the snake!  What's that all about?."
Flushed toilet and water coming out of the shower strainer?
Kitchen sink is draining into bathtub. Bathtub is not draining at all. Toilet stills flushes.?
"Dishwasher floods from bottom of toilet seal.  This is a mystery!  Can you solve it?  Husband has poured boiling water down drains, cleaned traps and used a snake to clean drains.  Still nothing happens.  Some one says septic needs to be pumped?  But why does the toilet flush?."

"so in my bathtub downstairs, one i don't really use, more of a guest bathroom. I want to replace the hardware drain plug.  Its one of those round silver drain plugs that you have to press and turn to get it to close shut and then do the opposite for it to open.  I want that one gone and just get a rubber stopper.  . . In emptying my dehumidifer in there and also mopping up some dirt and things because of a flood in the basement, things have gotten caught in the drain, and since I cant get to them because of the drain type and not being able to remove the silver top, i'm stuck for now.. . the silver drain doesnt seem to want to unscrew or twist off.  and I dont know how to get it to come off.  Is it somehow connected to the overflow plate, (prob not.)  I just don't know how to get this press and turn drain cover off to start using something different.. underneath ? There is no way I can get to the underneath, it is in the basement on a concrete floor. i do know there are probably pipes under the floor, but have not seen any kind of crawlspace for my house.."
"Washing machine flooded my room, how can i take care of this?"
can I set up a sort of siphon system to keep my toilet from flooding my apartment?
It seems water is backing up through my toilet and spilling onto the floor. it has no connection to the use of water within this apartment (although there are another three within this house. Anyway I was wondering if I could rig up a sort of siphoning system within the toilet so that when it randomly rises throughout the day while i'm not home it will allow it to drain into the bathtub rather than the floor. just until the problem can be looked at by a professional. If this is possile and someone could give me some guidelines that would be fantastic. thanks..
RENTING HOUSE: drainage clogs about once a week! overflow into kitchen and floods bathtubs?
how long do i need to have the water hit me before i have the big o and also wont i flood myself?.
"I rent an apartment, and the renter upstairs had a problem with a dishwasher (don't ask, I don't get it).  She flooded her apartment, but most of the water came right down into my apartment, damaging the walls and the ceiling. The drywall in my kitchen came down. . . My landlord has said he will take care of things, but what obligation is he under, and what am I entitled to? He will need to tear down, drywall, sand and paint.  Will I need to pay rent while construction is going on?. Interesting that no one is answering my question about what obligation the LANDLORD has.."
my upstairs neighbour flat flood caused by british gas damaging my property?

Upstairs neighbors washer caused a flood...is my apartment flooded too?
"im stuck at work (leavin asap but it takes an hour to get home), just recieved a call that the apartment above me is flooded due to some malfunction in thier washer.. what are the chances my place is flooded?? how badly?."
"I own my condo, my upstairs neighbor rents. He flooded both our apartments. Is he or his landlord responsible?"
"I contacted the landlord and he said he would pay for my floors to be replaced, but would not pay for any personal property damaged, for example rugs, luggage, time off from work. He said by law his tenant should be responsible for all damages, but because neither of them have insurance, he would atleast fix my floors. Please advice, is the landlord responsible for fixing all units damaged by his tenants irresposibililty of leaving the water from the tub running while intoxicated?."
"I recently came home to find my kitchen, laundry room, and front entrance way way (as well as the hall leading to my door) flooded because my upstairs neighbor had left her water on.. I have had several issues with this neighbor and recently gave the landlord a letter documenting the issues thus far.. In my lease it states that the management can not be held liable for ""the actions or ommissions of other tenants"" which makes sense.. My question is, do I have any recourse directly with the upstairs neighbor?. (There were several items in the laundry room, which I was using for storage, that were ruined including several holiday decorating items and my roomates vacuum.  We also discovered a crack in our ceiling where more water was dripping on the carpet in the living room.. The maintanence guy used a box cutter to cut a small whole, about one inch long and only a few milimeters wide, so that the water coming from here would all come out that one whole and not the length of the crack.)."
"where can i find out about apartment laws in texas, regarding smoke detectors?"
"My smoke detector was damaged when the neighbors upstairs flooded their apartment.  It was a little over two weeks before anyone came to inspect the smoke detector which was not working.  When they finally did fix it.  They didn't bother to attach it back to the ceiling.  So at this point it is hanging from the wires.  Also, does anyone know if there is a city inspector or some such person who can inspect the apartment for mold due to the water damage in the walls and carpet?."
how do I arrange local guardian or news groups to come and visit my home for them to report my issues?
